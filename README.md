# The effects of Glucose-Induced Insulin Response on Perceived Attraction


Abstract:

This study evaluates whether physical manipulation of a person’s insulin levels results in a change in their attraction to others. A sample of people (N=30) were randomly assigned to drink a beverage (Sprite or Sprite Zero) and then rate faces on a 7-point Likert scale from Extremely unattractive to Extremely attractive. It was hypothesized that an increase in insulin in a person’s body would result in an increase in attraction ratings towards the faces presented. A total of 40 faces were presented to participants, 20 before an insulin spike was expected to occur and 20 after. In general, participants rated faces post the expected insulin spike as more attractive, regardless of the beverage they drank. 

Using a mixed ANOVA and linear regression, the present study shows that manipulating a person’s insulin levels has no significant association with a change in attraction levels. All participants had a significant increase in their attraction ratings after a break when insulin levels were expected to spike. While there was a higher attraction rating in the group that drank Sprite compared to the Sprite Zero group, there was no significant interaction noted between the types of beverages and time spent rating faces. Ultimately, the original hypothesis was not supported. However, the study gives room to analyze what might lead a person to rate other people as more attractive the longer they spend perceiving them.

Highlights:

•	There is no association shown to exist between insulin levels and attraction.

•	All individuals tend to rate people as more attractive the longer they spend rating.
