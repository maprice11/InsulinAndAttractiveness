# The effects of Glucose-Induced Insulin Response on Perceived Attraction


# Abstract:

This study evaluates whether physical manipulation of a person’s insulin levels results in a change in their attraction to others. A sample of people (N=30) were randomly assigned to drink a beverage (Sprite or Sprite Zero) and then rate faces on a 7-point Likert scale from Extremely unattractive to Extremely attractive. It was hypothesized that an increase in insulin in a person’s body would result in an increase in attraction ratings towards the faces presented. A total of 40 faces were presented to participants, 20 before an insulin spike was expected to occur and 20 after. In general, participants rated faces post the expected insulin spike as more attractive, regardless of the beverage they drank. 

Using a mixed ANOVA and linear regression, the present study shows that manipulating a person’s insulin levels has no significant association with a change in attraction levels. All participants had a significant increase in their attraction ratings after a break when insulin levels were expected to spike. While there was a higher attraction rating in the group that drank Sprite compared to the Sprite Zero group, there was no significant interaction noted between the types of beverages and time spent rating faces. Ultimately, the original hypothesis was not supported. However, the study gives room to analyze what might lead a person to rate other people as more attractive the longer they spend perceiving them.

# Highlights:

•	There is no association shown to exist between insulin levels and attraction.

•	All individuals tend to rate people as more attractive the longer they spend rating. 

# My contribution

My role in the project was cleaning the data, running the statistical analysis, and creating visualizations. I ran two tests, a linear regression and a mixed ANOVA. 

The linear regression was used to reflect whether a person's insulin level led to a change in attraction rating.

The visualization I created indicates that there was no significant effect on attraction ratings, even when a person's insulin changed. 

The mixed ANOVA was used to consider the interaction between the type of drink (Sprite/Sprite Zero) and time (before vs. after drink).

While there is a clear difference in attraction ratings before and after drinking, there is no evidence that this change is due to drinking a beverage. 

It should be noted that there was controlled significance found in the time and drink type variables. There was a significant increase from the pre- to post- attraction ratings from the entire sample, and the participant group that drank Sprite rated faces as being significantly more attractive than the participant group that drank Sprite Zero. All of these statistical analyses give way for further discussion to occur. 

# Reflection

The most valuable thing I learned from this project was how to run statistical tests in Python, as well as creating visualizations from those projects. The main thing I wish that we could have changed is using a larger sample size over a longer period of time to ensure that participant's insulin levels are spiking to their full potentioal.
